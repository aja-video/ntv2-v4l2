## Requirements

Builds in 3.10.0 <= linux (64 bit) <= 4.14.0 (approximately)

The driver has been tested on Ubuntu 14 and Centos 7.

AJA Video IO board support:
- Kona 4
- Corvid 44
- Corvid 88
- Corvid HB-R

## Building the Driver

The v4l2/alsa driver is located in /driver.  A simple 'make' will build
the driver.  If there are build errors they may be due to v4l2 interface
changes.  To manage this there are several kernel version #ifdef(s)
in ntv2_common.h.  The kernel versions are approximate; you may need
to adjust them for your kernel.

## Loading the Driver

To load the driver use:	'sudo make install'.
The install target modprobe(s) several dependencies before loading the ntv2video.ko driver

## Unloading the Driver
To unload the driver use: 'sudo make uninstall'.
Unloading the driver requires exiting any application
that has opened the driver including the system audio mixer (pulseaudio).

## Running Some Tests

	qv4l2		/* simple v4l2 capture */
	cheese		/* can do frame grabs */
	audacity	/* capture audio */

	vlc alsa:// --input-slave v4l2://	/* capture video and audio */
